| Concept                   | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dynamic Room Mapping**  | Each client belongs to a room; broadcast limited to that group |
| **Server-Side State**     | Per-client structure maintains name + room                     |
| **Scoped Broadcast**      | Messages confined to room membership                           |
| **Command Parsing Layer** | Extensible interface for protocol-like features                |
| **Graceful Leave & Join** | Automatic notifications for room entry/exit                    |
