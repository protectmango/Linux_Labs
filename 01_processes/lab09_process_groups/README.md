# Lab 09 ‚Äì Process Groups & Foreground/Background Control

---

## üß≠ Objective

Learn how Linux groups related processes together, lets them share job control signals, and manages who ‚Äúowns‚Äù the terminal.

By the end of this lab you‚Äôll:

* Understand **process groups** and **sessions**.
* Create and manipulate them with `setpgid()`, `getpgid()`, `setsid()`.
* Control which group is **foreground** with `tcgetpgrp()` / `tcsetpgrp()`.
* Build a minimal **shell-like demo** where background jobs still run, and the foreground job owns the terminal.

## üß† Core Concepts

| Concept                      | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Process Group**            | A collection of one or more processes that can receive signals as a unit.                   |
| **Session**                  | A collection of process groups, usually created by a login shell or a controlling terminal. |
| **Foreground Process Group** | Only one group can read from the terminal at a time ‚Äî the ‚Äúforeground‚Äù group.               |
| **Job Control Signals**      | `SIGINT`, `SIGTSTP`, `SIGCONT`, `SIGHUP` are delivered to the entire foreground group.      |

## üß© Explanation

1. **`setpgid(0, 0)`** ‚Üí makes the first child the leader of a new process group.
2. **`setpgid(0, child1)`** ‚Üí adds the second child into the same group.
3. The parent prints both PGIDs, then uses

   ```c
   kill(-pgid, SIGINT);
   ```

   to broadcast `SIGINT` to every process in that group.
4. `tcsetpgrp(STDIN_FILENO, pgid)` transfers the terminal‚Äôs control to that group ‚Äî meaning `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+Z` will now affect it.
5. Finally, the parent reclaims the terminal and terminates all children.

## üß∞ Try It Out

```bash
cd lab09_process_groups
make
./process_groups_demo
```

You‚Äôll see each process print its PID/PGID, then when the parent broadcasts `SIGINT`, both children react together.
