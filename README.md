# Linux Labs Series (Community Interactive Project)

## 🎯 Vision

“To build an open, hands-on lab ecosystem for learning and experimenting with Linux internals, system programming, and networking — by doing, not just reading.”

Each lab will:

- Run as a small self-contained program or container.

- Have a README with theory + tasks + source code.

- Be replicable on any Linux machine or in Docker.

- Include interactive demos (CLI, socket tools, browser dashboard, etc.).

- Be paired with a YouTube walkthrough & GitHub repo.
